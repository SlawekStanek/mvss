This repo holds ARM templates to deploy a "Minimum Viable Scale Set" (MVPP) and illustrates how to modify such a template to achieve different scenarios. Each branch has a template, so you can see the difference between templates using `git diff`. To start, take a look at the branch called `minimum-viable-scale-set`.
